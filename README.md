## Instructions

- To update this make sure to create a new Unity project or use an existing one.
- Go to Window > Package Manager
- Click on + then **Add package from disk** where you will browse to the package.json file from this repo.
- Click on the package.json file within Unity to make any version, references, or any platform specific modifications. You can also add scripts under Runtime as needed, I already created an [Assembly Definition](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/cus-asmdef.html) but if you need to make any changes then look at the com.learnxr.core.asmdef file.

### Additional Resources

These are a few helpful resources which I used for this:

- Creating custom packages [docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CustomPackages.html)
- Packages layout [docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/cus-layout.html)
